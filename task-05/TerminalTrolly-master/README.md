# TerminalTrolly

Greetings, Shoppers! Welcome to the TerminalTrolly Challenge—a test of your problem-solving skills in the world of web.

Imagine you're part of a team responsible for managing a trendy online hypermarket. Unfortunately, our e-commerce platform has encountered unexpected technical issues, leaving customers unable to make purchases through the website.

To keep our loyal customers happy and the business running smoothly, we've devised a special challenge for you. Using a terminal-based interface—a digital lifeline to our shop's backend—you'll step into the shoes of our tech-savvy troubleshooters.

Your mission is clear: navigate through the virtual maze of glitchy code and faulty scripts to successfully purchase products from our hypermarket.

## Briefing on the basics

If you haven't got much knowledge of HTML and CSS, don't worry! HTML is a language used to describe the structure of the pages you see on the browser, whereas CSS enables those pages to look beautiful and tidy. Additionally, JavaScript can be used to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, and animate images! 

Here are some resources to help you learn :

## Guidlines

In this task, you are provided with a website containing a broken terminal. Your first objective is to recreate the User Interface (UI) displayed on the left side of the terminal, as shown in the demo provided below. You have to fetch the assets needed from the API we have provided. The design can be customized freely while ensuring it contains all the elements shown in the demo.

Your next objective is to integrate functional commands into the terminal. Below are the commands to implement along with their descriptions:

- list: Display all available products.
- details 'product_id': View details of a specific product identified by its ID.
- add 'product_id': Add a specific product to your cart using its ID.
- remove 'product id': To remove the product from the cart
- cart: View the current items in your cart.
- buy: Proceed to a new webpage where you can review items in your cart along with the total price, enabling you to finalize your purchase.
- clear: Clear the terminal screen.
- search 'product_name': Search a product by name.
- sort 'price/name': Sort the products based on the price or the name.

Implementing these commands will make the terminal interactive and functional. The "buy" command, in particular, should lead to a webpage displaying your cart contents and total price, facilitating the checkout process.

Your creativity, as well as the design and functionality of the UI and the terminal, will be evaluated. Remember to ensure the webpage is responsive!
