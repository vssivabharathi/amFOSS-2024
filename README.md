## About Me

Hey there!

I am V.S Sivabharathi and I’m super excited to be a part of this club. I am passionate about solving real problems and assisting others and believe in the power of working together as well as always learning. As someone who is keen on machine learning and deep learning, I keep finding out new ways that these can be used for impactful projects.

I like going to developer conferences like Google I/O and Apple’s WWDC and look forward to being one of such events someday. My reasons for choosing me, my goals for the next six months, as well as how will I give back to the club are what this README entails.

## WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?

You should choose me because solving problems is my passion, moreover I can assist people through coding. If it means coming up with new ideas, organizing events or helping in club tasks, I am willing to take charge of them all.

## WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS? HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THEM?

Over the next six months, my primary goals are:

**Excellent goals!** To further enhance your plan, let's incorporate a stronger emphasis on machine learning and deep learning.

1. **Deepen Knowledge:**

   - **Core Focus:** Strengthen understanding of programming languages and various technologies.
   - **Expanded Focus:** Develop a solid foundation in machine learning and deep learning concepts and algorithms.

2. **Competitive Programming:**

   - **Core Focus:** Participate in and excel at competitive programming contests.
   - **Expanded Focus:** Apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problem sets.

3. **Leadership Development:**

   - **Core Focus:** Take on a leadership role within the club, contributing actively to its growth.
   - **Expanded Focus:** Explore opportunities to lead projects related to machine learning or data science.

4. **Communication:**
